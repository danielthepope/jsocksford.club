# jsocksford.club

> A showcase of socks from the JSOxford community.

### Add your socks

To add your own socks to the gallery create a pull request adding an image into the [/images](/images) directory with the filename as your name.

If a file with your name already exists you can append a number like so: `marcus.jpg` => `marcus.2.jpg`

### Run locally

Run `build.sh` to create the required `socks.js` file - an index of all the socks in the `images` directory.

Then host the directory using something like [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) from NPM.
